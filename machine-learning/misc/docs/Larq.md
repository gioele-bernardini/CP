# **Building and Training a Binary Neural Network with Larq and TensorFlow on the MNIST Dataset**

## **Introduction**

Binary Neural Networks (BNNs) represent a class of neural networks in which the weights and/or activations are binarized to values such as -1 and 1, significantly reducing computational complexity and memory usage. This report details the implementation and training of a BNN using Larq, a specialized library for BNNs, in conjunction with TensorFlow and Keras. The focus is on training the BNN to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

### **Objectives:**

- To implement a BNN using Larq and TensorFlow.
- To preprocess and normalize the MNIST dataset for optimal model performance.
- To build and train a BNN capable of high accuracy while maintaining low computational requirements.
- To evaluate the model's performance on unseen test data.

## **1. Importing Necessary Libraries**

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow.keras import layers, models
import larq as lq
from tensorflow.keras.datasets import mnist
from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Shebang Line:** `#!/usr/bin/env python3` specifies that the script should be run using Python 3.
- **TensorFlow and Keras:** These libraries provide the foundational tools for building, training, and evaluating deep learning models.
- **Larq:** A library specifically designed for creating and training BNNs, extending Keras functionalities with quantization layers.
- **MNIST Dataset:** A well-known dataset consisting of 70,000 images of handwritten digits, commonly used for training image processing systems.
- **to_categorical:** This function converts class labels to one-hot encoded vectors, essential for training classification models.

### **Rationale:**

Each of these libraries plays a crucial role in constructing and training the BNN, from model definition to data handling and performance evaluation.

## **2. Loading and Preprocessing the MNIST Dataset**

```python
# Load and preprocess the MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Normalize the data
x_train = x_train.astype("float32") / 255
x_test = x_test.astype("float32") / 255

# Reshape to fit the model
x_train = x_train.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)
x_test = x_test.reshape(-1, 28, 28, 1)

# Convert labels to one-hot encoding
y_train = to_categorical(y_train, 10)
y_test = to_categorical(y_test, 10)
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Loading Data:** The MNIST dataset is split into training and testing subsets.
- **Normalization:** Data is scaled from integer values (0 to 255) to float values between 0 and 1, enhancing the model's training stability.
- **Reshaping:** Images are reshaped into 28x28 pixels with a single channel, preparing them for input into the convolutional layers.
- **One-Hot Encoding:** Labels are converted to one-hot vectors, which is the required format for multi-class classification in neural networks.

### **Rationale:**

Preprocessing ensures the dataset is in a format that the BNN can efficiently process and learn from. Normalization and reshaping align the data with the input requirements of the network, while one-hot encoding prepares the labels for categorical cross-entropy loss calculation.

## **3. Building the Binary Neural Network Model**

```python
# Build the binary neural network model
def build_binary_model():
    model = models.Sequential()

    breakpoint()
    # First binary convolutional layer
    model.add(
        lq.layers.QuantConv2D(
            32, kernel_size=3, strides=1, padding="same", input_shape=(28, 28, 1),
            kernel_quantizer="ste_sign", 
            input_quantizer="ste_sign", 
            use_bias=False
        )
    )
    model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
    model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))

    # Second binary convolutional layer
    model.add(
        lq.layers.QuantConv2D(
            64, kernel_size=3, strides=1, padding="same",
            kernel_quantizer="ste_sign", 
            input_quantizer="ste_sign", 
            use_bias=False
        )
    )
    model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
    model.add(layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=(2, 2)))

    # Binary dense layer
    model.add(layers.Flatten())
    model.add(
        lq.layers.QuantDense(
            128,
            kernel_quantizer="ste_sign",
            input_quantizer="ste_sign",
            use_bias=False
        )
    )
    model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())

    # Output layer
    model.add(lq.layers.QuantDense(10, kernel_quantizer="ste_sign", input_quantizer="ste_sign", use_bias=False))
    model.add(layers.BatchNormalization())
    model.add(layers.Activation("softmax"))

    return model

model = build_binary_model()
```

### **Explanation:**

The function `build_binary_model()` constructs the BNN by stacking multiple layers:

- **Sequential Model:** Layers are added sequentially to build the architecture.
- **First Binary Convolutional Layer:** 
  - **QuantConv2D:** Applies binarization to both weights and activations, using the `ste_sign` quantizer, which maps values to -1 or 1.
  - **BatchNormalization:** Stabilizes and accelerates training by normalizing the activations.
  - **MaxPooling:** Reduces spatial dimensions and increases robustness to spatial variances.

- **Second Binary Convolutional Layer:** Similar to the first but with more filters, allowing the network to capture more complex features.

- **Binary Dense Layer:** Fully connected layer with binary weights and activations, crucial for combining features extracted by convolutional layers.

- **Output Layer:**
  - **QuantDense:** Final layer with 10 neurons for the 10 classes, also binarized.
  - **Softmax Activation:** Converts the output to probabilities across the classes.

- **Breakpoint:** The `breakpoint()` function is placed for debugging, allowing the inspection of the model's state at this point.

### **Rationale:**

This architecture is tailored to efficiently classify MNIST digits while minimizing computational overhead. The use of binary layers significantly reduces the memory and processing power required, making it suitable for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

## **4. Compiling the Model**

```python
# Compile the model
model.compile(
    optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(learning_rate=0.001),
    loss="categorical_crossentropy",
    metrics=["accuracy"]
)
```

### **Explanation:**

- **Optimizer:** Adam is chosen for its efficiency and adaptability, adjusting learning rates dynamically to ensure fast convergence.
- **Learning Rate:** Set to 0.001, a commonly used value that balances learning speed and stability.
- **Loss Function:** `categorical_crossentropy` is used, which is standard for multi-class classification problems. It measures the difference between the predicted and actual probability distributions.
- **Metrics:** Accuracy is used to evaluate how well the model performs in correctly classifying the images.

### **Rationale:**

The selected optimizer, loss function, and metrics are well-suited for the task at hand, ensuring that the model is both efficient and effective during training.

## **5. Training the Model**

```python
# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=64, validation_data=(x_test, y_test))
```

### **Explanation:**

- **`fit()` Method:** This initiates the training process.
- **Epochs:** Set to 10, meaning the entire training dataset is passed through the network 10 times.
- **Batch Size:** 64 samples per gradient update, balancing between speed and convergence stability.
- **Validation Data:** The model's performance is evaluated on unseen test data after each epoch, providing insight into how well the model generalizes.

### **Training Process:**

1. **Forward Pass:** Input data is passed through the network to produce predictions.
2. **Loss Calculation:** The discrepancy between predictions and true labels is calculated.
3. **Backward Pass:** The loss is propagated back through the network to update weights.
4. **Weight Update:** Weights are adjusted based on gradients computed in the backward pass.
5. **Validation:** After each epoch, the model is evaluated on the validation set to monitor generalization.

### **Output:**

Training outputs include loss and accuracy metrics for both training and validation sets, which help in monitoring the modelâ€™s progress and diagnosing potential issues like overfitting or underfitting.

## **6. Evaluating the Model**

```python
# Evaluate the model
test_loss, test_acc = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f"Test accuracy: {test_acc}")
```

### **Explanation:**

- **`evaluate()` Method:** The trained model is evaluated on the test dataset to measure its performance on unseen data.
- **Test Loss and Accuracy:** The final loss and accuracy on the test set are printed, providing a quantitative measure of the model's performance.

### **Rationale:**

This final evaluation on the test set gives an unbiased estimate of the model's performance, indicating how well it can generalize to new, unseen data.

### **Expected Outcome:**

- **High Test Accuracy:** A high accuracy score indicates that the model has successfully learned to generalize from the training data to make accurate predictions on new data.
- **Comparison with Validation Accuracy:** Consistency

 between validation and test accuracy suggests the model is neither overfitting nor underfitting.
